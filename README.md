##Introduction
The real estate market is a dynamic and multifaceted sector, influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, demographics, and increasingly, environmental elements. As potential homebuyers, real estate investors, and climate researchers navigate this complex landscape, understanding the interplay between these factors becomes crucial. Our project aims to provide insights into specific relationships within the housing market, focusing on income brackets for households versus house values, the correlation between house sizes (i.e., bed and bath counts) and price ranges, and the impact of weather on home sales. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset of home sales in 2022 and integrating weather data, we aim to create informative visualizations to aid decision-making and research in these areas.

##Problem Statement
The real estate market is subject to various influences that can affect property values, sales trends, and overall market dynamics. Key areas of interest include:

- How do household income brackets correlate with house values in different regions?
- What is the relationship between house sizes (measured by the number of bedrooms and bathrooms) and their price ranges?
- How does weather influence home sales and market activity?
- 
However, analyzing these relationships poses several challenges:

- The dataset includes over 600K rows of home sales data from 2022, with significant variation across states and regions.
- The absence of household income data necessitates the use of external sources for income-related insights.
- The need to integrate weather data with real estate data to assess environmental impacts on the housing market.
